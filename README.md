## Thanks for viewing my portfolio!

I created this portfolio page from scratch in vanilla HTML5 / CSS / JS without AI assistance to showcase my front-end ability. In lieu of a database, details about each project are loaded in from a JSON file using the fetch API, then injected into an HTML template. With the exception of Bootstrap, this project is dependency-free.
